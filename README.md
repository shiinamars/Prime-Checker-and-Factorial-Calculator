The task is to write a program to:
- Check if a given number is prime or not.
- Find the factorial of a given number.
- Create a simple graphical interface where the user can enter the number in a textbox.
- Ensure to include comments in your code to explain how it works.
- Explore ways to optimize your code for faster execution time.
